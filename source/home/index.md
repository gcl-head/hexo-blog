## Introduction

Hello, this is a [hexo](https://hexo.io/) blog Using Vesselin Tzvetkov's [solar-theme](https://github.com/tzvetkov75/solar-theme-hexo). I will share my study and life here. Hope you can find what you want here and have fun.

Actually, this is my second personal blog. My last blog, a big curde through, can also be called minimalism, is based on Vue and Django with the idea of learning web development technology. If interested, you can visit it through [bighead.net.cn](https://bighead.net.cn/), or if the website cannot be accessed, you can directly see the code by checking [github.com/gcl-head/blog](https://github.com/gcl-head/blog).
